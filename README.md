This is a test dashboard, you will only obtain the 4 first columns, you have to complete the rest or take my example dashboard [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rK8lxw48UlSps4O93S9EYRzBaaMkP6FCixmQOCPKQJ0/edit?usp=sharing).

You first have to get you own Trello Token and API key and replace them in the main.js
